      <p>Hot Wheels · 1971</p>
      <p>The Beatnik Bandit was one of the original "Sweet Sixteen" Hot Wheels cars released in 1968, designed by Ed "Big Daddy" Roth. This 1971 redline version features the classic spectraflame paint and redline wheels that collectors prize.</p>
      <p>The design showcases Roth's signature style with its bubble top canopy and wild proportions. This particular model represents the golden age of Hot Wheels when the brand was revolutionizing the die-cast car market.</p>
